abstract="Many studies have established that microblog streams, e.g., Twitter and Weibo, are leading indicators of emerging events. However, to statistically analyze and discover the emerging trends around these events in microblog message streams, e.g., popularity, sentiments, or aspects, one must identify messages related to an event with high precision and recall. In this paper, we propose a novel problem of automatically discovering meaningful keyword rules, which help identify the most relevant messages in the context of a given event from fast moving and high-volume social media streams. For the specified event, such as {\{}{\#}trump{\}} or {\{}{\#}coronavirus{\}}, our technique automatically extracts the most relevant keyword rules to collect related messages with high precision and recall. The rule set is dynamic, and we continuously identify new rules that capture the event evolution. Experiments with millions of tweets show that the proposed rule extraction method is highly effective for event-related data collection and has precision up to 99{\%} and up to 4.5X recall over the baseline system.",

A large number of these datasets are surfacing online in public and private catalogs, often annotated with XML metadata, as part of community efforts to foster open research. With this rapid expansion comes the challenge of filtering and selecting datasets that best match the needs of scientists. We address a key aspect of the scientific data discovery process by ranking search results according to a personalized data quality score based on a declarative quality profile to help scientists select the most suitable data for their applications. Our quality model is resilient to missing metadata using a novel strategy that uses provenance in its absence. Intuitively, our premise is that the quality score for a dataset depends on its provenance – the scientific task and its inputs that created the dataset – and it is possible to define a quality function based on provenance metadata that predicts the same quality score as one evaluated using the user’s quality profile over the complete metadata. Here, we present a model and architecture for data quality scoring, apply machine learning techniques to construct a quality function that uses provenance as proxy for missing metadata, and empirically test the prediction power of our quality function. Our results show that for some scientific tasks, quality scores based on provenance closely track the quality scores based on complete metadata properties, with error margins between 1 – 29%.},

  abstract                 = {The growing recognition of the importance of provenance for data intensive and multidisciplinary domains is leading to careful collection of provenance. One consequence of this is the proliferation of provenance repositories hosted for individual organization or communities, with limited ability to reconstruct and query for and on provenance across them. Community standards like the Open Provenance Model (OPM) allow uniform interpretation and exchange of provenance metadata but do not prescribe query or service specifications to access provenance. If data reuse and sharing across institutions is not accompanied by passing provenance at the time of data exchange, we need to track the provenance and query for them or over them across distributed provenance repositories. In this article, we present approaches for querying over distributed provenance information, and address two common provenance query models that we formalize: provenance retrieval query and provenance filter query. Our problem is motivated by Smart Oilfield applications in the energy informatics domain, and we evaluate the performance of our algorithms using synthetic workflows based on the domain.},

We identify and analyze the relative merits of these approaches in an effort to inform practitioners planning to support OPM in their existing provenance/workflow systems.

Provenance forms a glue linking workflow execution with associated data products, and finds use in determining the quality of derived data, tracking resource usage, and for verifying and validating scientific experiments. In this article, we discuss the scope of provenance collected in the Karma provenance framework used in the LEAD Cyberinfrastructure project, distinguishing provenance metadata from generic annotations. We further describe our approaches to querying for different forms of provenance in Karma in the context of queries in the first provenance challenge. We use an incremental, building-block method to construct provenance queries based on the fundamental querying capabilities provided by the Karma service centered on the provenance data model. This has the advantage of keeping the Karma service generic and simple, and yet supports a wide range of queries. Karma successfully answers all but one challenge query.

The focus of our work is on provenance collection for these workflows that are necessary to validate the work-flow and to determine quality of generated data products. The challenge we address is to record uniform and usable provenance metadata that meets the domain needs while minimizing the modification burden on the service authors and the performance overhead on the workflow engine and the services. The framework is based on generating discrete provenance activities during the lifecycle of a workflow execution that can be aggregated to form complex data and process provenance graphs that can span across workflows. The implementation uses a loosely coupled publish-subscribe architecture for propagating these activities, and the capabilities of the system satisfy the needs of detailed provenance collection. A performance evaluation of a prototype finds a minimal performance overhead (in the range of 1% for an eight-service workflow using 271 data products).},

  abstract                 = {Computational Grids have become an important asset in large-scale scientific and engineering research. By providing a set of services that allow a widely distributed collection of resources to be tied together into a relatively seamless computing framework, teams of researchers can collaborate to solve problems that they could not have attempted before. Unfortunately the task of building Grid applications remains extremely difficult because there are few tools available to support developers. To build reliable and re-usable Grid applications, programmers must be equipped with a programming framework that hides the details of most Grid services and allows the developer a consistent, non-complex model in which applications can be composed from well tested, reliable sub-units. This paper describes experiences with using a software component framework for building Grid applications. The framework, which is based on the DOE Common Component Architecture (CCA), allows individual components to export function/service interfaces that can be remotely invoked by other components. The framework also provides a simple messaging/event system for asynchronous notification between application components. The paper also describes how the emerging Web-Services model fits with a component-oriented application design philosophy. To illustrate the connection between web services and Grid application programming we describe a simple design pattern for application factory services which can be used to simplify the task of building reliable Grid programs. Finally we address several issues of Grid programming that better understood from the perspective of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. In particular we describe how models for collaboration and resource sharing fit well with many grid application scenarios.},

  abstract  = {As scientific and engineering domains attempt to effectively analyze the deluge of data arriving from sensors and instruments, machine learning is becoming a key data mining tool to build prediction models. Regression tree is a popular learning model that combines decision trees and linear regression to forecast numerical target variables based on a set of input features. Map Reduce is well suited for addressing such data intensive learning applications, and a proprietary regression tree algorithm, PLANET, using MapReduce has been proposed earlier. In this paper, we describe an open source implement of this algorithm, OpenPlanet, on the Hadoop framework using a hybrid approach. Further, we evaluate the performance of OpenPlanet using realworld datasets from the Smart Power Grid domain to perform energy use forecasting, and propose tuning strategies of Hadoop parameters to improve the performance of the default configuration by 75% for a training dataset of 17 million tuples on a 64-core Hadoop cluster on FutureGrid.},

  abstract  = {Abstract—Smart Grid modernizes power grid by integrating digital and information technologies. Millions of smart meters, intelligent appliances and communication infrastructures are under deployment allowing advanced IT applications to be developed to protect and optimize power grid operations. Demand response (DR) is one such emerging application to optimize electricity demand by curtailing/shifting power load when peak load occurs. Existing DR approaches are mostly based on static plans such as pricing policies and load shedding schedules. However, improvements to power management applications rely on data emanated from existing and new information sources with the grow of Smart Grid information space. In particular, dynamic DR algorithms may depend on information from smart meters that report interval-based power consumption measurement, HVAC systems that monitor buildings heat and humidity, and even weather forecast services. In order for emerging Smart Grid applications to take advantage of the diverse data influx, extensible information integration is required. In this paper, we develop an integrated Smart Grid information model using Semantic Web techniques and present case studies of using semantic information for dynamic DR. We show the semantic model facilitates information integration and knowledge representation for developing the next generation Smart Grid applications.},

In this article, we propose a Generic Worker framework to deploy and invoke science applications in the cloud with minimal user effort and predictable cost-effective performance. Our framework addresses three distinct challenges posed by the cloud: the complexity of application deployment, invocation of cloud applications from desktop clients, and efficient transparent data transfers across desktop and the cloud. We present an implementation of the Generic Worker for the Microsoft Azure Cloud and evaluate its use for a genomics application. Our evaluation shows that the user complexity to port and scale the application is substantially reduced while introducing a negligible performance overhead of of &lt;; 5% for the genomics application when scaling to 20 VM instances.},

  abstract  = {Cloud computing is increasingly considered as an additional computational resource platform for scientific workflows. The cloud offers opportunity to scale-out applications from desktops and local cluster resources. Each platform has different properties (e.g., queue wait times in high performance systems, virtual machine startup overhead in clouds) and characteristics (e.g., custom environments in cloud) that makes choosing from these diverse resource platforms for a workflow execution a challenge for scientists. Scientists are often faced with deciding resource platform selection trade-offs with limited information on the actual workflows. While many workflow planning methods have explored resource selection or task scheduling, these methods often require fine-scale characterization of the workflow that is onerous for a scientist. In this paper, we describe our early exploratory work in using blackbox characteristics for a cost-benefit analysis of using different resource platforms. In our blackbox method, we use only limited high-level information on the workflow length, width, and data sizes. The length and width are indicative of the workflow duration and parallelism. We compare the effectiveness of this approach to other resource selection models using two exemplar scientific workflows on desktop, local cluster, HPC center, and cloud platforms. Early results suggest that the blackbox model often makes the same resource selections as a more fine-grained whitebox model. We believe the simplicity of the blackbox model can help inform a scientist on the applicability of a new resource platform, such as cloud resources, even before porting an existing workflow.},

For example, the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) coefficient, overlaid on regional maps, is provided each day by the California Department of Water Resources to local farmers and turf managers to plan daily water use. Scaling out single-processor compute/data intensive applications operating on realtime data to support more users and higher-resolution data poses data engineering challenges. Cloud computing helps data providers expand resource capacity to meet growing needs besides supporting scientific needs like reprocessing historic data using new models. In this article, we examine migration of a legacy script used for daily ET<inf>0</inf> computation by CIMIS to a workflow model that eases deployment to and scaling on the Windows Azure Cloud. Our architecture incorporates a direct streaming model into Cloud virtual machines (VMs) that improves the performance by 130% to 160% for our workflow over using Cloud storage for data staging, used commonly. The streaming workflows achieve runtimes comparable to desktop execution for single VMs and a linear speed-up when using multiple VMs, thus allowing computation of environmental coefficients at a much larger resolution than done presently.},

In this initial investigation we added semantically annotated provenance to the Life Science Grid, a cyber-infrastructure framework supporting interactive data exploration and automated data analysis tools, through (i) automated data provenance collection and (ii) automated semantic enrichment of the collected provenance metadata. We use a paradigmatic life sciences use case of interactive data exploration to show that semantically annotated provenance can help users recognize the occurrence of specific patterns of investigation from an otherwise low-level sequence of elementary interaction events.},

  abstract  = {Scientific workflows have gained popularity for modeling and executing in silico experiments by scientists for problem-solving. These workflows primarily engage in computation and data transformation tasks to perform scientific analysis in the Science Cloud. Increasingly workflows are gaining use in managing the scientific data when they arrive from external sensors and are prepared for becoming science ready and available for use in the Cloud. While not directly part of the scientific analysis, these workflows operating behind the Cloud on behalf of the -data valetsￃﾂￂ﾿ play an important role in end-to-end management of scientific data products. They share several features with traditional scientific workflows: both are data intensive and use Cloud resources. However, they also differ in significant respects, for example, in the reliability required, scheduling constraints and the use of provenance collected. In this article, we investigate these two classes of workflows - Science Application workflows and Data Preparation workflows - and use these to drive common and distinct requirements from workflow systems for eScience in the Cloud. We use workflow examples from two collaborations, the NEPTUNE oceanography project and the Pan-STARRS astronomy project, to draw out our comparison. Our analysis of these workflows classes can guide the evolution of workflow systems to support emerging applications in the Cloud and the Trident Scientific Workbench is one such workflow system that has directly benefitted from this to meet the needs of these two eScience projects.},

These repositories built on commodity clusters need to reliably ingest data continuously and ensure its availability to a wide user community. Workflows provide several benefits to modeling data-intensive science applications and many of these benefits can help manage the data ingest pipelines too. But using workflows is not panacea in itself and data valets need to consider several issues when designing workflows that behave reliably on fault prone hardware while retaining the consistency of the scientific data. In this paper, we propose workflow designs for reliable data ingest in a distributed environment and identify workflow framework features to support resilience. We illustrate these using the data pipeline for the Pan-STARRS repository, one of the largest digital surveys that accumulates 100TB of data annually to support 300 astronomers.},

The framework, based on a loosely-coupled publish-subscribe architecture for propagating provenance activities, satisfies the needs of detailed provenance collection while a performance evaluation of a prototype finds a minimal performance overhead (in the range of 1\% for an eight service workflow using 271 data products).},

An e-science portal is a conventional Web portal that sits on top of a rich collection of web services that allow a community of users access to shared data and application resources without exposing them to the details of Grid computing. In this chapter we describe a service-oriented architecture to support this type of portal.},

  abstract                 = {The Linked Environments for Atmospheric Discovery (LEAD) [122] is a National Science Foundation funded1 project to change the paradigm for mesoscale weather prediction from one of static, fixed-schedule computational forecasts to one that is adaptive and driven by weather events. It is a collaboration of eight institutions,2 led by Kelvin Droegemeier of the University of Oklahoma, with the goal of enabling far more accurate and timely predictions of tornadoes and hurricanes than previously considered possible. The traditional approach to weather prediction is a four-phase activity. In the first phase, data from sensors are collected. The sensors include ground instruments such as humidity and temperature detectors, and lightning strike detectors and atmospheric measurements taken from balloons, commercial aircraft, radars, and satellites. The second phase is data assimilation, in which the gathered data are merged together into a set of consistent initial and boundary conditions for a large simulation. The third phase is the weather prediction, which applies numerical equations to measured conditions in order to project future weather conditions. The final phase is the generation of visual images of the processed data products that are analyzed to make predictions. Each phase of activity is performed by one or more application components.},

To this end, a functional magnetic resonance imaging workflow was defined, which participants had to either simulate or run in order to produce some provenance representation, from which a set of identified queries had to be implemented and executed. Sixteen teams responded to the challenge, and submitted their inputs. In this paper, we present the challenge workflow and queries, and summarize the participants' contributions.
